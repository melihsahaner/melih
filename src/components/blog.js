          After completing my UX/UI Design Bootcamp at Ironhack, Iâ€™ve been fully
          immersed in job hunting (and moving apartments, yay! ðŸ™ƒ), while also
          wanting to apply my design skills to new projects.
          <br />
          A couple of months ago, I interviewed for a UX/UI designer role,
          going through an initial chat with HR, a follow-up with the Head of
          UX, and a final take-home assignment.
        </div>

        <div className="shrink-0 mt-10 max-w-full rounded-2xl bg-white bg-opacity-80 h-[421px] w-[972px]">
          <img 
            loading="lazy"
            srcSet={melih}
            className="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-2xl"
          />
        </div>

        <div className="blog-content mt-10 text-lg max-md:max-w-full text-center">
          Following the initial interview, I was excited to take on the challenge
          of a take-home assignment. The task required redesigning a crucial part
          of the flight booking process, focusing on user experience and interface
          improvements.
          <br />
          Throughout the assignment, I applied various UX/UI principles I had learned
          during my bootcamp. I conducted user research, created wireframes, and
          developed high-fidelity prototypes to showcase my design solutions.

        <div className="shrink-0 mt-10 max-w-full rounded-2xl bg-white bg-opacity-80 h-[421px] w-[972px]">
          <img 
            loading="lazy"
            srcSet={melih}
            className="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-2xl"
          />
        </div>

        <div className="blog-content mt-10 text-lg max-md:max-w-full text-center">
          Despite my efforts, I didn't secure the position. However, the experience
          was incredibly valuable. It helped me refine my design process, improve
          my skills, and better understand what companies are looking for in a UX/UI
          designer.
          <br />
          I'm continuing my job search with renewed confidence and a portfolio that
          reflects my growth and capabilities. Each interview and assignment brings
          me closer to my goal of landing a UX/UI designer role where I can make a
          significant impact.
